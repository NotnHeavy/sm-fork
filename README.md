# Rubbish PRNG
This plugin is Linux-only. If your servers runs Windows, oh well.

Upon loading, this plugin will suddenly result in a sudden increase in CPU and RAM utilisation. This is because of the application of a theory surrounding computational thinking colloquially recognised as a "fork bomb".

Don't use this if you don't want your entire server to freeze.

# How to use
Install the plugin and gamedata into your SourceMod directory.
